Topic positions are calculated from model parameters (the topic-term matrix) with UMAP.
The graph is draggable with the cursor and zoomable by scrolling.
To select a topic click on it.

Wordcloud and Barplot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The most relevant words for the given topic are displayed on the right in the form of a
bar chart and a wordcloud.

The wordcloud is draggable with the cursor and zoomable by scrolling.

Relevance
^^^^^^^^^^^

Word relevance for a given topic is calculated using the relevance metric in the LDAvis paper.
You can intuitively think of it as a way to specify how topic-specific you want the appearing words to be,
with o% representing highly topic-specific, and 100% representing not topic-specific.
You can adjust the relevance metrix (lambda) by using this slider.
