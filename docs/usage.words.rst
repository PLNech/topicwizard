Word distances are calculated from correlations between words in topics.
Positions are calculated with UMAP.
You can zoom this graph by dragging your cursor and enclosing a selection area.

Selecting Words
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can select words by typing them into the field on the top left and searching for them.
Multiple words may be selected at the same time.
Clicking a word on the map adds the word to the selection.

Associations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Closely associated words also get highlighted on the graph and are included in calculations.
The most closely associated words are the ones that have the lowest distance to the given words.
Topicwizard finds the specified amount of closest words to the selected ones.
The number of associated words can be adjusted with this slider:
